Program # 4

Description of the Problem:
	Create an inheritance hierarchy that a bank might use to represent customersâ€™
	bank accounts. All customers at this bank can deposit (i.e., credit) money into
	their accounts and withdraw it (i.e. debit) money from their accounts. More
	specific types of accounts also exist. Savings accounts, for instance, can earn
	interest on the money they hold. Checking accounts, on the other hand, charge a
	fee per transaction (i.e, credit or debit).

Pseudo Code:
	There are 3 different test cases (Account, Savings, and Checking Account) and
	each test case uses the Default Constructor and the Initialized Constructor.

	Each test proves the following functions:
		- tests the creation of the class
		- uses member function get_balance() to display bal variable
		- uses member function credit(double x) to add values to bal
		- uses member function debit(double x) to subtract values from bal
		- error checking debit(double x) so that the account is not overdrawn

	Savings Class Test includes the additional:
		- tests calculate_interest(double x) to calculate the given interest based
		on the given rate and then adds that to bal

	Checking Class Test includes the additional:
		- tests the redefined debit(double x) function so that it will subtract the
		fee associated with each successful debit from bal using debit(double x)
